# Initial Concept
Improve the remote management of Meshtastic nodes with a specialized toolset and governance pack, building upon the contact terminal UI.


# Product Guide - Meshtastic Contact

## Target Audience
- **Meshtastic Node Operators:** Individuals who need an efficient, keyboard-driven interface to manage their devices locally or remotely.
- **Meshtastic Developers:** Engineers building tools, firmware (such as the MrG4dget branch), or custom protobuf integrations who require a reliable testing and management platform.

## Core Goals
- **Streamlined Management:** Simplify the complexity of configuring Meshtastic nodes, including settings adjustment, backups, and restores, through a robust terminal interface.

## Key Features
- **Configuration Management:** Robust tools for reading, writing, and backing up node configurations to ensure device consistency and easy recovery.
- **Diagnostic Toolset:** Integrated support for traceroute and real-time packet monitoring to troubleshoot mesh connectivity and performance.

## Strategic Approach
- **Modular Compatibility:** Maintain a core set of features compatible with the official Meshtastic ecosystem while providing a clean path for integrating specialized or experimental features (e.g., MrG4dget firmware support) without compromising the base experience.
