# Repo governance (Antigravity rule)

> AUTO-GENERATED by `scripts/agents/sync_shims.py`.

Follow the canonical instructions in `AGENTS.md`.

## Non-negotiables
- Edit canonical sources only (`AGENTS.md`, `docs/agents/**`, `.agents/skills/**`).
- Regenerate shims after governance/skill changes: `python scripts/agents/sync_shims.py`.
- Validate changes: `python ci/validate_agent_assets.py`.

## Proactive Maintenance
- **Knowledge**: Check `knowledge/` for context before starting. Maintain KIs for new insights per `docs/agents/KNOWLEDGE_SUBAGENT.md`.
- **Workflows**: Use `.agent/workflows/` for standard tasks (e.g., `validate-agent-assets.md` for CI).
- **Documentation**: Sync `docs/agents/` if governance, skills, or shims are modified.
